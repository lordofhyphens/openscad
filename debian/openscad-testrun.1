.TH OPENSCAD-TESTRUN 1 "2012-02-16"
.\" Please adjust this date whenever revising the manpage.
.SH NAME
openscad-testrun \- set up and run the OpenSCAD test suite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openscad-testrun
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBopenscad-testrun\fP command.
.PP
\fBopenscad-testrun\fP is a script that sets up a directory in which the
OpenSCAD test suite (implemented in ctest) can be run by creating symlinks to
the system locations of the input data, and runs it. The created directory is
not removed, but will contain the test results in addition to the symlinks.

It is required as the test suite in its original form expects all the test
input and output data in relative locations, and the typical user has no write
access to where the data resides. Future changes to the test suite might make
it more flexible, removing the need for this script.
.SH OPTIONS
